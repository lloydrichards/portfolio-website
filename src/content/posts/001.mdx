Hello everyone! I'm excited to announce that I'm starting the rebuild of my portfolio using Next.js. This is a project that I've been wanting to tackle for a while now, and I'm finally ready to dive in.

## Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js as my framework of choice for a few reasons. First, it's built on top of React, which I'm already familiar with. Second, it's great for SEO and performance out of the box. And third, it has a great ecosystem of plugins and tools that I can use to build out my portfolio.

## What's in Store?

I'm planning on using a few different technologies to build out my portfolio. Here's a quick rundown:

|                       |                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Storybook**         | As a developer I think it's important to have a design system in place. I'll be using Storybook to build out my components and document my design system. |
| **Contentlayer**      | Writting blogs like this one is a big part of my portfolio. I'll be using Contentlayer to manage my blog posts and projects.                              |
| **D3.js**             | I'm a big fan of data visualization, so I'll be using D3.js to create some interactive charts and graphs.                                                 |
| **React-Three-Fiber** | As i'm learning to use Three.js to also create 3D visualization, I'll be using React-Three-Fiber to create some interactive 3D scenes.                    |
| **Tailwind CSS**      | I'm a big fan of Tailwind CSS and will be using it to style my portfolio.                                                                                 |
