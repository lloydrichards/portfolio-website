import { SVGSystem } from "../../lab_modules/007";

The plan with this is to have a small system of pipes and boxes that
move around in a circle. There needs to be multiple paths that it can
take with an input, a cycling feature, and a garbage. The plan is:

- Create SVG paths in Figma that lead around in a few ways.
- Add a few buttons to add a square, pause, and reset
- Add probability to move between different lines
- Add state for garbage collected overtime
- (optional) Add the ability to remove a pipe which will cause the
  squares to fall to the garbage

Lets jump into this!

<SVGSystem />

Used Figma and SVGOMG to create paths that were copy and pasted into the
page component. Each one was given a unique id and colour to help
identify them. Currently there are three paths:

```text
Garbage -> Grind 1 -> Pellet 2 -Product 2
Garbage -> Grind 1 -> Pellet 2 -Product 3
Garbage -> Grind 2 -> Pellet 1 -Product 1
```

Buttons added and moved to the centre of the diagram. Had to move their
zIndex up since they were being blocked by the SVGs when trying to
click. Debugged with a console log to make sure everything is working.

Hooked up some simple random logic that generates a new piece each time
something gets to the end. By pressing 'Add' you can introduce parts to
the system which will cycle around and around. Need to set up some more
logic as well as a seperate state for the possible direction. Will also
be usefull to figure out how to remove the elements after they complete
as it slows down after a while.

Would also be interesting to play around with the 'speed' of the
assembly line by having a contant that can be changed which effects the
speed proportionally. There is a method on the `anime.path()`
that should allow to figure out its length and then use some kind of
velocity calculated off of distance/time.

Added a filter that removes the object when its converted to the next
type. Have also implimented a lookup table for what paths the item can
take. Now the state remains the same size throughout, though the ids of
each object changes. Would like to next work on a click event to
highlight something and then pass this property along to the next
conversion. Additionally Id like to try splitting up the conversion so
when 'garbage' converts to 'grind' it results in say 5 smaller circles
which could go either way. Additionally, some conversions could only
take place when a certain amount have accomulated, say when 5 pellets
are turned into a product.
