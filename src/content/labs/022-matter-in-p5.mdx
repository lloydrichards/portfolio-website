One of the things I've been thinking about is how to intergrate physics into
P5.js. I've been looking at Matter.js and it seems like a good
option. I've already worked with d3-force which worked well with D3.js but I
think Matter.js might be a better option for P5.js.

## Basic Physics

I started with a basic example from the Matter.js website. I wanted to see how
it would work with P5.js. It was pretty easy to get it working. I just had to
create the Engine, World and Bodies with Matter and then with my Box class I can
create a new Box and pass in the Matter.js body. Then in the draw loop I just
have to update the Engine and then draw the boxes.
