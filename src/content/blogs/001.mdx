This will be the start of a fairly odd project, but one that I've been wanting
to do for a long time. So why not document the process üòÑ. The problem starts
with a dating app called [Feeld](https://feeld.co/). The basic premise is that
this is a dating app for couples or those interested more in polyamorour or
alternative relationships. This is a super interesting concept, especially from
a UX perspective, but unfortunately the app comes no where near its own
potential.

What I'm hoping to acheive in this series is to first go in an examine whats
wrong with the app currently and then re-envision it as something more true to
the core user. This will be partly design and partly code as I'd like to make a
basic MVP of my concept that could be used to test the user experiance. Lets
jump right in!

## Users

From my experiance using the app I've noticed four distinct groups of users
based on their intent with the app. From these four there are multiple
combinations of gender, orientation and sexual preference. But lets start with
breaking down these user stories.

### Baby Poly's üë∂

New to the polyamory scene, have little experiance but are curious about the
possibilies.

#### Facts

- Single
- Little/no experiance

#### Problems

Looking for others seeking alternative relationships. Not sure what they want.

#### Behaviours

Might use the app for intense periods at the start but overtime will loose
interest or if they mind a monogamous relationship will abandon the app.

#### Needs & Goals

- Find others with similar goals
- Safely engage others
- Inclusive space for exploration

### Unicorns ü¶Ñ

Single people looking for sexual experiances with couples or groups.

#### Facts

- Single or in relationship
- Sexual appetite for couples
- Some experiance

#### Problems

Looking for couples open to a third person in relationship/bed. Able to see
everyone involved and be part of a group conversation.

#### Behaviours

Use app from time to time when in the mood. Aren't seeking relationships so will
usualy not continue chatting with couples after. Will want to 'cast a large net'
and see what interests them.

#### Needs & Goals

- Larger pool of people
- Group chat with couple, not just one person
- Clear intentions for the interaction

### Unicorn Hunters üèπ

Couples looking to spice up their sex life by bringing in a single person to
play with.

#### Facts

- Couple
- Sexual appetite for threesomes
- Use the app together

#### Problems

Are in relationship but want to have a sexual experiance together with another
person. Private and don't want this to be known by their closer friends/family.

#### Behaviours

Use the app togehter, searching profiles and dicussing together outside the app
their interests. Might have different preferences or desires. Will use the app
periodically but more consistantly over time as long as they enjoy it.

#### Needs & Goals

- Privacy
- Group chat
- Clear intentions from start

### Poly Couples üíë

Couples looking for relationships with other experianced poly couples.

#### Facts

- Couple
- Seeking friendship/relationship
- Have experiance with open relations

#### Problems

Have a hard time finding others with similar ideas about relationships. Feel
marginalized or objectified in other dating apps. Feel misunderstood.

#### Behaviours

Use the app regularly to interact with other poly couples. Will typically find
another relationship, meet, and then move to another app like WhatsApp for
futher communication.

#### Needs & Goals

- Group Chat
- Chat organization/filtering
- Clear boundaries about relationships

        There are of course many many other types of users, and part of that is
        the pure USP of this app that it allows such a scope of different users
        with different desires and needs. Without diving into the gender
        diversity on the app, I think its best to understand why people are
        there as opposed to other dating apps, and what they get from Feeld that
        other apps don't provide.

        "We believe nothing is more unpredictable or less binary than human
            desire. This is why we created Feeld, where everyone can be honest
            with themselves while being responsible towards others." ~Feeld

            ## Current App

             As the app currently stands there are two main functionalities when
        using regularly. The first is the search functionality, where you set
        preferences for what you are looking for and then have a typical
        Like/Dislike way of searching for matches. The second is the chat
        functionality where you can view matches, start conversations with them
        and create group chats.
