## Overview

The Life of Plastic project was a final internship project when I
first worked for IxT. The goal of the project was to create a
visualization that would help people understand the life cycle of
plastic bottles and the impact of recycling.

## Life of Plastic Tutorial

Plastic, like most consumable packaging, has for a long time been
a through-put design. Resources would be used to make bottles,
which would be consumed and eventually thrown away. In this model,
resources move in one direction, from production to consumption.

<Example1 />

Thankfully, in the 21st century, we have recycling which promises
to loop the resources back into the production cycle and divert
them from becoming waste. In an ideal system, resources would
never reach landfills and instead be caught in a regenerative
cycle.

<Example2 />

Unfortunately, our current recycling system is just not that
efficent and we are left with some material being recycled back,
while some is still diverted to landfills. While every recycling
system is different, in general PET plastic bottles could be
reused up to 7 times. This is roughly 85% efficent.
