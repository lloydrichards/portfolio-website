      <H2>Blog 001 - Starting Feeld Redesign</H2>

      <Content>
        This will be the start of a fairly odd project, but one that I've been
        wanting to do for a long time. So why not document the process üòÑ. The
        problem starts with a dating app called{' '}
        <a href='https://feeld.co/'>Feeld</a>. The basic premise is that this is
        a dating app for couples or those interested more in polyamorour or
        alternative relationships. This is a super interesting concept,
        especially from a UX perspective, but unfortunately the app comes no
        where near its own potential.
      </Content>
      <Content>
        What I'm hoping to acheive in this series is to first go in an examine
        whats wrong with the app currently and then re-envision it as something
        more true to the core user. This will be partly design and partly code
        as I'd like to make a basic MVP of my concept that could be used to test
        the user experiance. Lets jump right in!

      <H3 style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>Users</H3>
      <Content>
        From my experiance using the app I've noticed four distinct groups of
        users based on their intent with the app. From these four there are
        multiple combinations of gender, orientation and sexual preference. But
        lets start with breaking down these user stories.

        There are of course many many other types of users, and part of that is
        the pure USP of this app that it allows such a scope of different users
        with different desires and needs. Without diving into the gender
        diversity on the app, I think its best to understand why people are
        there as opposed to other dating apps, and what they get from Feeld that
        other apps don't provide.

        As the app currently stands there are two main functionalities when
        using regularly. The first is the search functionality, where you set
        preferences for what you are looking for and then have a typical
        Like/Dislike way of searching for matches. The second is the chat
        functionality where you can view matches, start conversations with them
        and create group chats.

        <ContentList>
          <li>
            Primary actions such as Like/Dislike and Super Like are places at
            the bottom for quick access
          </li>
          <li>
            Profiles are not always indicative of the user, depends on how they
            set up their account.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chats always start with just 1-on-1 and the group chat feature is an
            extra step.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a lot of focus on paid features such as the Like You
            sections and the heart in the Menu
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no way to organize the chat or know more about each Chat
            appart from remembering.

      <Content>
        <ContentList>
          <li>
            Pictures and Profiles require vertical and horizontal swipe motions.
            These are regularly confused, resulting in it being hard to view
            pictures.
          </li>
          <li>
            Matches appear out of order so it is hard to find someone you has
            recently matched.
          </li>
          <li>
            25% of the buttons on Menu are for paid features resulting dead
            space for non paying users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Profiles for couples are sometimes created by a single person
            resulting in them being incorrectly labeled
          </li>
          <li>
            Search preferences are very narrow and result in a lot of incorrect
            pairing
          </li>
          <li>
            The focus is on finding new people, not in chatting with the people
            you already matches. Results in stale connections.

        What is of particular notice when reading through the reviews is that
        several themes come up. Leaving out those who were just frustrated they
        didn't get more matches, there seems to three main greavances:
      </Content>
      <ContentList>
        <li>The app is too glitchy and has too many technical issues.</li>
        <li>
          The concept is great, but the execution doesn't live up to the idea.
        </li>
        <li>The paid features do not add value to the experiance.</li>
      </ContentList>

        I'm also quite interested in the massive difference in rating between
        the android and apple version. Whether this means that there are two
        versions or if android users are just more honest? Certainly there seems
        to be more feedback from the developers on the App Store, but at the
        same time most of the reviewers do not give their name and give star
        rating quite different from the text review.
